        ✅ Detail documentaion (Introduction)

❓1️⃣What is React?
👉Js library to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces
👉Developed by facebook in 2011
👉Currently most widely used JS library for front-end development
👉Used to create single page application.(SPA)

2️⃣Working of DOM 
👉 Browser takes HTML and create DOM.
👉 Js helps us modify DOM based on user actions or events.
👉 In big applications, working with DOM becomes complicated.

3️⃣Problems with JavaScript
👉React has a simpler mental model
👉JS is cumbersome (time consuming)
👉Js is Error-prone
👉Js is hard to maintain

❓React Learning Reasons:-
👉Efficient and lightweight

4️⃣Working of React
👉No need to worry about querying and updating DOM
👉React creates a web page with small and reuseable components
👉React will take care of creating and updating DOM elements
👉IT saves a lot of time, things are simple and code are alreadt written.

5️⃣JS Vs React
👉JS is imperative: You define steps to reach your your desire state.
👉 React is Declarative: You define the target UI state and then reach out how to reach that state.

❓How to use React?
👉 Create components, and make data if you need it, link the data and change data whenever you want, react will reactt whenever there is change in data.

6️⃣ Introduction to components
👉Components helps us to write reuseable
👉modular 
👉better organized

🙏React application is a tree of component with App Component as the root bringing everything together.

❓When is React used?
👉Whenever we are creating a app of little higher level with loads of ongoing stuff with the use of reuseable components

7️⃣ Setup IDE
👉 1. IDER stands for Integrated Development Environment.
👉 2. Software suite that consolidates basic tools required for software development
👉 3. Central hub for coding, finding problems and testing.
👉 4. Designed to improve developer efficiency.
    
    7️⃣.1️⃣ Need of IDE
    👉 1. Streamlines development
    👉 2. Increases productivity
    👉 3. Simplifies complex tasks.
    👉 4. Offers a unifies workspace.
    👉 5. IDE Features
          5.1 Code Autocomplete
          5.2 Syntax Highlighting
          5.3 Version COntrol
          5.4 Error Checking

    7️⃣.2️⃣ Install latest Node
    7️⃣.3️⃣ Install latest VS Code

8️⃣ Create a React App (CRA)
👉 1. Official tool is CRA(Create React App)
👉 2. Vite is a modern tool to create React Project
👉 3. Vite produces Quick and Small bundle size.
👉 4. Vite: Use npm run dev to launch dev server.
👉 5. Use npm start for CRA.


9️⃣ Project Structure
👉 1. node_modules/ has all the installed node packages
👉 2. public/Directory: Contains static files that dont change.
👉 3. src/ Directory : Main folder for the React code.
    3.1 components/:Reusable parts of the UI, like buttons or headers.
    3.2 assets/: Images, font, and other static files.
    3.3 styles/:CSS or stylesheets.
👉 4. package.json contains information about this project like name, version, dependencies on other react packages.
👉 5. vite.config.js contains vite config.

      
          ✅Creating React Components
          
 🔟File Extensions
  👉.Js 
      * Stands for JavaScript
      * Contains regular JavaScript code
      * Used for general logic and components

  👉.JSX 
      * Stands for JavaScript XML
      * Combines JavaScript with HTML-like tags
      * Makes it easier to design UI components

❓Where to start React and where to run?
👉 We will use VS-Code Editior to write a code and Chrome to run the code.

❓Things to do before writing code in VS-Code
👉Installing Vite and before that you must have downloaded node.

❓
👉npm create vite@latest

❓
👉Go to cmd and open the folder by cd in our case its react

❓within cmd, inside react type..
👉 npm create vite@latest

❓
👉Need to install the following packages:
  create-vite@5.1.0
Ok to proceed? (y)

❓? Project name: » vite-project
👉? Project name: » IstReact

❓
👉
C:\Users\Rajan Aryal#\Desktop\React>npm create vite@latest
√ Project name: ... IstReact
√ Package name: ... istreact
√ Select a framework: » React
√ Select a variant: » JavaScript

❓
👉C:\Users\Rajan Aryal#\Desktop\React>cd IstReact

C:\Users\Rajan Aryal#\Desktop\React\IstReact>npm i


❓
👉added 270 packages, and audited 271 packages in 1m

97 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details

found 0 vulnerabilities

C:\Users\Rajan Aryal#\Desktop\React\IstReact>


❓
👉PS C:\Users\Rajan Aryal#\Dropbox\My PC (LAPTOP-0IPFI41A)\Desktop\React\IstReact> npm run dev

❓Actually now we deleted React folder which was inside desktop because it was giving an error
👉PS C:\Users\Rajan Aryal#\Dropbox\My PC (LAPTOP-0IPFI41A)\Desktop\IstReact>

❓We delete everything inside App.jsx
👉We downloaded the extension called ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets


❓
👉And then we went inside App.jsx and write rfce and enter and there will be component



👉Open cmd and chage directory to desktop because we want to make app on the desktop
👉cd desktop

❓
👉npm create vite@latest

❓What if, we are creating the app for first time?
👉Need to install the following packages:
  create-vite@5.1.0
Ok to proceed? (y)

❓
👉? Project name: » GoReact

❓ok, how is the final look?
👉
C:\Users\Rajan Aryal#\Desktop>npm create vite@latest
√ Project name: ... GoReact
√ Package name: ... goreact
√ Select a framework: » React
√ Select a variant: » JavaScript

Scaffolding project in C:\Users\Rajan Aryal#\Desktop\GoReact...

Done. Now run:
  cd GoReact
  npm install
  npm run dev

## DO everything IN CMD BECAUSE IT WILL MAKE EASY


❓What are in number 28, 29, and 30
👉 Well these given by cmd itself and says that we are good to make app

❓Whats the next step?
👉 Heading to code Editor. And open the folder we just created, GoReact


❓
👉Will run npm i, on the terminal, inour case it can be opened by ctrl+j

❓What is the output when you run, npm i?
👉PS C:\Users\Rajan Aryal#\Dropbox\My PC (LAPTOP-0IPFI41A)\Desktop\GoReact> npm i
added 270 packages, and audited 271 packages in 1m
97 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details
found 0 vulnerabilities
PS C:\Users\Rajan Aryal#\Dropbox\My PC (LAPTOP-0IPFI41A)\Desktop\GoReact> 

❓Any extension do we need to download?
👉 Yes, if you have not:- ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets

❓Next?
👉And then we went inside App.jsx after deleting everything, we write rfce and enter and there will be component

// just to let you know, make sure this app is not inside another folder, make sure the root folder is itself GoReact, else it may create problem at the beginning

❓When is to wtite, npn run dev?
👉You can write anythime after installing npm, once you run npn run dev there will be link to the local host.

❓What is component?
👉Component is a function which returns jsx. Example:-
        function App() {
          return (
            <div>App</div>
          )
        }

❓ What is jsx?
👉 jsx is very similar to html with superpowers. Example
    <div>App</div>
